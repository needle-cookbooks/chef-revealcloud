# Tags are managed here:  https://app.copperegg.com/#revealcloud/tags

#   or you desire multiple servers to have the same label
#   in the Dashboard and Alerts.
#   If this is not your desire, you may want to use a tag instead.
# Note: Do not include spaces in your label.
# Note: Leaving blank will not remove a label that is already set on a monitored system.
# Optional.  This field may be left blank.
# Example: "MySQL_Master"
